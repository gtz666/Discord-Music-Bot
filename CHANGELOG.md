## v0.3.0 ‚Äì April 1, 2025

### Major Improvements
- Use ! commands instead of slash commands to avoid conflict with Discord Default commands
- Refactored `!play` to **immediately insert and play** a song (without clearing the queue)
- Ensured bot **moves voice channel automatically** if user is in a different one
- `!play` now triggers `vc.stop()` properly to skip current track

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed issue where `!play` would add song but not play
- Fixed double entries in playback history (`!show`)
- Prevented crash when `!leave` is called mid-play
- Improved queue logic: current song is now **not** part of queue (`now_playing` is separate)
- Loop logic updated (`loop single` reinserts current track correctly)

### New Commands
- `!add` ‚Äì Add a song to the end of the queue without playing
- `!leave` ‚Äì Disconnect bot from voice channel
- `!show` ‚Äì Displays current track, recent history (5 max), and upcoming queue
